<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

<p>The final project for my Machine Learning Class consisted of two components. The first component was binary classification on two datasets using different machine learning methods and comparing their performance. These methods included logistic regression, random forest, KNN, and Adaboost, and their performance was measured across different hyperparameters.
<br><br>The second component consisted of a Two Layer Neural Network with sigmoid activation and Cross-Entropy Loss for MNIST digit recognition. This was implemented using PyTorch and accuracy was approximately 98%</p>

<p>This project was completed with the collaboration of two other students, Yizhen Chen and Henry Muhlbauer</p>

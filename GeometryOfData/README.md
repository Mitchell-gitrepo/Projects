<h3>Geometry of Data Coursework</h3>

<p>These are my homeworks for my Geometry of Data class, which cover a variety of topics related to manifold learning ranging from Kendall Shape Space to Autoencoders to Natural Gradient Descent and KL-Divergence
<br><br>As these homeworks are being reused by the professor each semester, this repository will be under limited public visibility so as to prevent any cheating.</p>
